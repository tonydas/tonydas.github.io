Digital Logic and Computer Design - Morris Mano
I have used this book by Morris Mano during my BE course on Digital Electronics. This book is written in an easy to understand language. It includes the basic concepts of Boolean Algebra with some elementary problems and solved examples, non-sequential logical circuits using GATES, sequential logical circuits using Feedback circuits. Finally the book also includes implementing such digital circuits using basic components such as diodes and transistors.

The chapter on Boolean Algebra is quite exhaustive in coverage of the different concepts of simplifying the logical expressions. It includes a combination of simple and complex problems and solved examples which are helpful in getting started with the concepts of Digital Electronics.

The book is nicely structured and the flow of the concepts has been designed in such a way that it becomes very easy for beginners to attain the needed expertise and pursue more advanced concepts either in this book or from other books on Digital Electronics. This book can be used in conjunction to other courses on Basic Electronics.
